# Project Overview

This project aims to implement a configurable message broker in .NET, encapsulating important features such as the Publish/Subscribe pattern, append-only log per partition, offsets, consumer groups, commit offsets, back-pressure and Config + CLI tooling. 

The ultimate goal of this project is to really understand the implementation of message brokers, why their provided features help with a large-scale system, as well as proving my dexterity in using the C# language/.NET framework outside web applications.
